<b>Abstract:</b>

Spatial biodiversity knowledge is vital for effective conservation planning. The Half-Earth Project has created a comprehensive map of our planet’s biodiversity to inform and track conservation efforts and ensure that no species is driven to extinction from lack of knowledge.

  <figcaption>Spatial occurrence data of plant (red) and animal (blue) species contributed to GBIF in 2020. Central Park in Manhattan (left) contains 9,104 unique observations in an area of only 3.4 km$^2$, compared to just 3,846 unique observations in the entirety of Madagascar (right), with an area of 587,041 km$^2$.</figcaption>
