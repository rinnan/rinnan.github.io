<b>Abstract:</b>

Many species undergo significant shifts in population distribution in response to changes in climate. This response can introduce a species to new competition from invasive organisms, or influence the dynamics of an otherwise balanced ecosystem. How can a species ensure its own survival while dealing with both interspecific competition and the effects of climate change? We examine a two-species discrete-time, continuous-space population model to determine conditions for coexistence and criteria for persistence in a changing climate. Our analysis suggests that the cost of keeping pace with climate change can weaken the ability of a species to compete with others, and that climate change has the capacity to shift the stable-state solution of the population model. These effects are somewhat mitigated by niche differentiation, with the potential for habitat considered inhospitable to one species to provide refuge for the other.

Using this model we simulate a hypothetical population of native bull trout <i>Salvelinus confluentus</i> experiencing competition from invasive brook trout <i>S. fontinalis</i> as their river habitat warms due to climate change. Based on current climate projections, we find that bull trout are likely to disappear from the study area by 2080, with brook trout expanding their range in the absence of competition.

  <figcaption>Figure 5: Population distributions of bull (solid) and brook (dashed) trout for competition coefficients $\beta_m = 0.08, \beta_n = 0.01$. (a) shows the initial densities $M_{0}(x)$ and $N_{0}(x)$, with bull trout at carrying capacity $K_m=5.1$ in waters below 13$^\circ$C and brook trout at carrying capacity $K_n=15$ downstream of the primary section of bull trout habitat; (b) shows the densities $M_{2011}(x)$ and $N_{2011}(x)$ after one time step, with lower brook trout density in locations overlapping with bull trout due to competition; (c) shows $M_{2080}(x)$ and $N_{2080}(x)$ after 70 time steps, with an average warming of $c = 0.0377^\circ$ C/yr, with significant loss of bull trout habitat due to warming, and expansion of brook trout habitat in the absence of competition.</figcaption>
