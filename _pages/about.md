Welcome!

I am a data scientist who studies issues of equity and justice in social and environmental contexts. Most of my professional experience has been as a quantitative ecologist, but I have recently transitioned into topics more directly related to social progress. I am presently a data analyst with Yale's Office of Institutional Research, working on helping the University to advance understanding and improve on issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion. 

In addition, I am quite passionate about teaching and education, and the intersectionality of race and gender issues in science. I also enjoy thinking about how to communicate science effectively, and the art of the visual presentation of quantitative information. (Read: I like making pretty maps and graphs.) I find a great deal of beauty in the relationships of natural processes and phenomena, and the wealth of information that we can infer about the world from simple observation.

I previously worked as an associate research scientist at the [Yale Center for Biodiversity and Global Change](https://bgc.yale.edu/) and the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.yale.edu/) in New Haven, Connecticut. Prior to that I received a Ph.D. from the interdisciplinary [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management](https://quantitative.uw.edu/graduate/degree-programs/) program at the University of Washington in Seattle in June 2018, working with [Joshua Lawler](http://depts.washington.edu/landecol/) in the [School of Environmental and Forestry Sciences](https://sefs.uw.edu/) and [Mark Kot](http://faculty.washington.edu/mkot/) in the [Applied Math](https://amath.washington.edu/) department.

Outside of work I like to spend my time gardening, herding chickens and children, working outside on a variety of half-finished personal projects, cooking, and taking advantage of seasonal foraging activities.
