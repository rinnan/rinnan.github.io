I am currently a postdoctoral research associate with [Walter Jetz](https://jetzlab.yale.edu/) in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.yale.edu/) at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. I received a Ph.D. from the interdisciplinary [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management](https://quantitative.uw.edu/graduate/degree-programs/) program at the University of Washington in Seattle in June 2018, working with [Joshua Lawler](http://depts.washington.edu/landecol/) in the [School of Environmental and Forestry Sciences](https://sefs.uw.edu/) and [Mark Kot](http://faculty.washington.edu/mkot/) in the [Applied Math](https://amath.washington.edu/) department.

My research lies at the intersection of three fundamental flavors of ecology: landscape ecology, quantitative ecology, and conservation ecology. I use a wide variety of quantitative methods to understand broad biological patterns in space and time, and interpret these patterns to better understand how we can direct conservation efforts more effectively. I am particularly interested in population dynamics and species interactions, animal behavior and movement, the effects of climate change on speciesâ€™ distributions, and drivers of biodiversity patterns. I find a great deal of beauty in the relationships of natural processes and phenomena, and the wealth of information that we can infer about the world from simple observation. I also enjoy thinking about how to communicate science effectively, and the art of the visual presentation of quantitative information. (Read: I like making pretty maps and graphs.)

In addition, I am quite passionate about teaching and education, and the intersectionality of race and gender issues in science.
